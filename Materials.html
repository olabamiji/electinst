   <h4>MATERIALS</h4>
   <p>The standard and quality of material adopted in electrical wiring and installations play out to be highly significant. Substandard materials are not advised to be use. From wires and cables to socket outlets, risks are poss on minite basis even if not second if substandards are adopted.</p>
   <p>With the below information,you will able to switch between many best altanatives when considering what your electrician put bebore you as materials.</p>

   <h2>Wires and Cables</h2>
   <p>Wire helps in distribution of electricity or electrical signals from place to place.Wires come in differnt forms and are made from different materials. They are made in different forms such as color,shapes, types and sizes.</p>

   <h4 id="Cco">Color and color codes</h4>

<p>Electrical contractors and electricians work with electrical wire color codes on a daily basis. Anyone who are not one of these professionals might be wondering what the different colors of electrical wiring signify.</p>
<p> In order to use the electricity in our homes, a proper wiring is required. The collection of Electrical wiring and electrical devices like switches, sockets, meters and fittings is called Electrical Installation or Building Wiring. An electrical wire is a single solid or twisted Copper or Aluminum conductor with or without any insulation. </p>

<p>Each wire used for electrical wiring is marked with information like wire gauge, ampacity, maximum voltage, and maximum temperature. But a general color code is used to identify different types of conductors which are used in electrical wiring. We know that the power can be in either single – phase or three – phase. </p>

<p>Depending on the phase of the power supply, different colored wires are used for different voltages. In case of a single phase power supply, there are three wires one each for line, neutral and protective ground. In case of a three phase power supply, there are three wires for line 1,2 and 3, one for neutral and one for protective ground. </p>

    <p>  Before beginning, though, it’s important to realize that different countries use different wiring color codes. In some countries, all permissible wiring colors are specified by the applicable governing body, but in others only a few specific types of wiring are required to have specific colors. In those countries, the colors used for some types of wiring are simply established by local practices followed by electrical contractors and electricians. </p>

  <h4>Shapes and types</h4>
  <p>Wires come with different shape, types and sizes. These are based on the purpose to which wire is produced. Some are single core,some are multi-core. Some are solid,some are stranded, some are braided and some are special which contain both solid and stranded. We shall make the discusions on shapes and types the subject of another time and go straight to an important topic, wire materials and sizes.</p>
  <h4>Wire materials and sizes.</h4>
  <p> The most commonly used material for electrical wire is copper and aluminum, these are not the best conductors however they are abundant and low cost.Gold is also used in some applications because it is corrosion resistant. Silver also is used in some applications and even has conductive capacity more than copper.</p>
  <p>Some wires are made from iron and steel. Such wires are not good for electrical wiring but have their industrial applications. In nigeria,mandated wire for house wiring is annealed copper. The below is guide on materials and type of cables to be adopted in Nigeria.</p>

<h3>BY NIGERIA ELECTRICITY REGULATION COMMISION</h3> 
<h4 id="Cn">NIGERIAN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AND INSTALLATION STANDARDS</h4>
<h5>REGULATIONS 2015 </h5>
<h6>REGULATION NO: NERC/Reg/1/2015</h6>
<p>In exercise of the powers to develop Standards and make Regulations conferred by Sections 81 and

</div>
<div>
<p>Before We proceed, let discuss some terms.</p>
<h4>Resistivity</h4>
<p> Resistivity of materials is the resistance to the flow of an electric current. Some materials resisting the flow of current more than others</p>
<p> Ohms Law states that when a voltage (V) source is applied between two points in a circuit, an electrical current (I) will flow between them encouraged by the presence of the potential difference between these two points. The amount of electrical current which flows is restricted by the amount of resistance (R) present. In simple words, the voltage encourages the current to flow (the movement of charge), but it is resistance that discourages it. </p>
<p> Materials such as copper and aluminium are known for their low levels of resistivity thus allowing electrical current to easily flow through them making these materials ideal for making electrical wires and cables. Silver and gold have much low resistivity values, but for obvious reasons are more expensive to turn into electrical wires.

Then the factors which affect the resistance (R) of a conductor in ohms can be listed as:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">

<li>The resistivity (ρ) of the material from which the conductor is made. </li>
<li>The total length (L) of the conductor. </li>
<li>The cross-sectional area (A) of the  conductor. </li>
<li>The temperature of the conductor. </li>
 </ol></p>
 </div>
 <div>
<h4>Coductivity</h4>
<p>Conductiviti is direct opposite of resistivity in wires.While both the electrical resistance (R) and resistivity (or specific resistance) ρ, are a function of the physical nature of the material being used, and of its physical shape and size expressed by its length (L), and its sectional area (A), Conductivity, or specific conductance relates to the ease at which electric current con flow through a material.</p>

<h4>Ductility </h4>
<p>This is a measure of a material's ability to undergo significant plastic deformation before rupture, which may be expressed as percent elongation or percent area reduction from a tensile test.</p> 
<h4>Maleability</h4>
<p> This property is a material's ability to deform under compressive stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to form a thin sheet by hammering or rolling. Both of these mechanical properties are aspects of plasticity, the extent to which a solid material can be plastically deformed without fracture. Also, these material properties are dependent on temperature and pressure (investigated by Percy Williams Bridgman as part of his Nobel Prize-winning work on high pressures).</p>
<p>The below table shows some metals properties that involved transmission of electricity.</p>

<p>from the above table, copper and aluminum are the best alternatives to Silver which is the best.</p>
<p>Note that if resistivity of a wire is too high and conductivity is too low, power is converted into heat. <b>Basic efect of this are two:Number one is power is lost to heat genetation. You might be wondering why the same watt bulb bright defferently on different home, this is one of the causes as the power is lost when is been transfer. Two is,if the heat is continously generated fire can set in causing lost of property or even life.</b>,</p>
<h3 id="Cs">Sizes</h3>
<p>Wire sizes is measure in milimeter squre(mm<sup>2</sup>). They come by 0.5mm<sup>2</sup>, 0.75mm<sup>2</sup>, 1.0mm<sup>2</sup>, 1.5mm<sup>2</sup>, 2.5mm<sup>2</sup>, 4.0mm<sup>2</sup>, 6.0mm<sup>2</sup>, 10mm<sup>2</sup>, 16mm<sup>2</sup>, 25mm<sup>2</sup>, 35mm<sup>2</sup>.......</p>
<h3 id="Cr">Rating</h3>
<p>  Whenever a circuit is extended or rewired, or when any new circuit is installed, it is critical that the new wiring is made with wire conductors that are properly sized for the amperage rating of the circuit. The higher the amperage rating of the circuit, the larger the wires need to be in order to avoid excess heat that can melt wires and cause fires. The proper circuit size, as indicated by amperage, is determined by several factors, including the planned load on the circuit, the number of outlets or light fixtures, and the length of the circuit.</p>
<p> If you've shopped for electrical wire, you have likely noticed that there are many types and sizes of wire to choose from. Different types of wire are intended for different uses, but with any of these wire types, knowing the right wire size, or gauge, is key to making the right choice.</p>
<p> Electrical current is measured in ampacity, and each wire gauge has a maximum safe carrying capacity.Let cosider the usage of wire with some appliances in the below table.</p>
</div>

</table>
</div>
<div>
<p><b>NOTE:</b>The ratings in the table above are for standard copper NM sheathed cable, but there are instances where these amperage ratings vary.</p>

<p>For example, there is aluminum wiring in some homes, and aluminum wires have their own ampacity-carrying capacity. Aluminum wiring was once widely used, but because it was found that aluminum had a greater expansion profile under load, it often loosened wire connections and sometimes caused electrical fires. That is not to say you are necessarily at risk just because you have aluminum wiring, because those connections may work forever if not overloaded. But an evaluation and replacement with copper wiring may be a good idea.</p>
<p>Other materials are to be standard in compliance with IEC. If you are not sure of your materials, consult professionals.</p>
